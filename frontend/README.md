# Frontend

This is a placeholder React + Vite frontend. Replace this with your Lovable frontend code.

## API Configuration

The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

API calls to `/api/*` will automatically be forwarded to the backend.

## Environment Variables

You can create a `.env` file in this directory if you need additional configuration:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```
